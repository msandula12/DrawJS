# DrawJS
Doodle app built using just HTML, CSS and jQuery.

### Not meant to be a commercial competitor
There are tons of doodle/sketch apps out there, all of which are more sophisticated than DrawJS. My intention with DrawJS was to broaden my jQuery skillset and, more than anything, see if whether it was possible to build a doodle app using just HTML, CSS and jQuery. Turns out, it is!
